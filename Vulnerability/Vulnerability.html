var SI00 = "Vulnerability is a film I made that challenged me both mentally and in my film capabilities. It was originally supposed to be about finding nature in the big city compared to the small Montana town I grew up in but took a turn when I talked about my hip surgeries. It ended up being nothing like I had created before and my teacher challenged me to try a new editing style to make it the documentary it now is.";

var SI01 = "This screengrab shows the sunrise over Bayshore that my friend Nathan Hall shot one morning when we decided to get up early and walk there with a group of friends. The calm of the waves mixed with the colors of the sunset leads to a calming visual for the viewer as I start to talk about the heavier aspects of my subject matter and can visually start to struggle with it. It creates a nice break for the viewer and lets them have a second to absorb what I'm saying before contiuning on."

var SI02 = "This screengrab demonstrates the type of editing my teacher challenged me to do. While I will admit it definitely doesn't always look the best, I thought this clip ended up turning out very nice and meshed with what I was talking about adequately. The slight laughter you can hear from my friends and I helps lift the mood of the film and reminds the viewer how much better I am doing."	

var SI03 = "This screengrab is for sure the heaviest of the three that I chose, but it shows how emotional I tried to make this film. I wasn't afraid to show how much my surgeries affected me at the time and wanted the viewer to be able to feel that as well. During this scene, I am talking about missing out on my high school years first from COVID, and then from these surgeries that took away my sports and extracurriculars."
